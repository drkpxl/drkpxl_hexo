The internet is currently abuzz with talk about the Boox Palma, a sleek $300 e-reader that runs a very outdated version of Android. It’s praised for its ability to run Android apps, unlike the Kindle, which means you can read your favorite news sites, newsletters, and more. However, for me, the outdated Android version is a drawback, especially since I have a Pixel 7 just sitting unused in my nightstand. So, why not repurpose it into a dedicated reading device?

## Key Requirements

- **Not Tied to My Main Google Account**: I want to avoid emails and interruptions on this device.
- **Run in Black and White Mode**: Color can be distracting and may tempt me to watch YouTube instead of reading.
- **Be Selective About Apps**: Only install apps that enhance the reading experience (details below).
- **Use a Matte Screen Cover**: This reduces glare, making the screen more similar to that of an e-reader.

## This is how I did it:

### Reset and Update Android

- **Update All Software**: Since I hadn’t turned on the Pixel for six months, I began by updating all the software.
- **Set Up as a New Device**: I created a new “burner” Gmail account to keep my personal email off this device and avoid interruptions from meetings, notifications, etc.
- **Turn the Screen to Black and White Mode**:  
    Go to Settings > Accessibility > Color and Motion > Color Correction > Greyscale and toggle it on.  
    (Optional) Turn off Dark Theme. I find this makes it look more like an e-reader, but it’s up to you.  
    (Optional) Enable the Remove Animations toggle.  
- **Turn on Extra Dim**: This feature reduces the brightness further, which can be more comfortable for reading.

### Install a “Minimal” Launcher

Unlike iOS, Android allows you to customize your home screen’s look and functionality. There are many minimal launchers available—just search for “minimal launcher” in the Play Store and see which one you like.

I’m currently using Before Launcher, which I like because it allows me to limit notifications to only what I want to see, helping to further reduce distractions. I use the free version, but there might be better launchers out there. If you know of one I should try, reach out to me on Threads [@drkpxl_makes](https://www.threads.net/@drkpxl_makes).

### Download Reading Apps

Like launchers, there are countless apps for reading books and articles. Here’s what I started with:

- **Libby**: This app lets you borrow books from your local library and read them in the app. It’s a great way to access millions of books for free.
- **Moon+ Reader or ReadEra**: I’m torn between these two for reading EPUB books. I like the flexibility of ReadEra but prefer the UX of Moon+. Neither is a complete home run.
- **Instapaper**: I send all the articles and long-form web content I want to read from my main phone or computer to Instapaper so I can read them on this “e-reader.”
- **ChatGPT**: I use this to explore new concepts or dive deeper into subjects I’m reading about. It’s super helpful, and I also really like Claude.
- **Kiwi Browser**: I use this mainly for its dark mode for all webpages, which is great for night reading.

### Reading Newsletters

There are a lot of services like ReadWise that charge you $10 to display newsletters, but I prefer the simple Gmail app. With a brand new Gmail account, I only have long-form newsletters that I enjoy reading. Since RSS is basically dead, this has become my go-to method for discovering new content or catching up on the week. It creates the focus I need to consume without interruptions.

Some of the newsletters I subscribe to are:

- Morning Brew
- Built for Mars
- 1440 Daily Digest
- Longreads
- Ars Technica
- Hacker Newsletter

Your favorite website likely has a newsletter too. You can use this opportunity to unsubscribe from your main inbox and subscribe only to what you want here.

### Bookmark Key Sites

Many news sites are bloated with ads and other distractions. These slimmed-down versions are quick to load and free of clutter. For me, this beats visiting the websites, downloading apps, or using services like Apple News.

- NPR
- CNN Lite
- Hacker News
- Alter Slash
- Brutalist Report
- Skimfeed
- Fresh News

## Summary

That’s it! I now have a powerful, dedicated device that contains only the media I want—no Slack messages, email alerts, or calendar reminders. I can sit down with this device in the morning, enjoy my coffee, and catch up on the news without diving into work emails. If you have an old phone lying around, give this a try and see if it works for you. If it does, and you really want an eInk device, then maybe consider the Palma.
