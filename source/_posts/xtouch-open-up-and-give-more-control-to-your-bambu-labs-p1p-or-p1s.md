I love my P1S but have gotten spoiled with my Klipper screens on my Creality and Voron. I thought I could get by with the Dot Matrix, but I hated it. I use Home Assistant and MQTT to manage most of the printer, but wanted to have a better experience “at” the printer. Through way too much Googling, searching GitHub, and YouTube, I came across the **XTouch project**: [https://github.com/xperiments-in/xtouch](https://github.com/xperiments-in/xtouch)

This kick-ass project uses a **REALLY cheap touch screen** (but great quality and responsive) from AliExpress to tap into Bambu’s MQTT broker to open up a world of more options.

I’d walk you through the installation process, but it’s quite clear on the GitHub page. However, if you run into trouble, hit me up on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@drkpxl_makes) and I will do my best to answer.

## Hardware

- ESP32 Touch Display
  The display/ESP32 I got was [this one](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805752546813.html). I got it shipped to the US for $13.09 delivered.

## STLs

Depending on how you want to mount it, there are lots of options. I wanted a display that looks like my Voron and Creality machines and am really happy with how this model came out.

Some others I considered that may work for you are:

- [XTouch (P1Touch) Mount Dual Screen Remixed by dallasstarsfan](https://makerworld.com/en/models/14702#profileId-25406) 
 
In my searching, I came across the **Teaching Tech YouTube channel**, where the host Michael covers the project in depth and the model he made to solve his particular needs. It’s a great watch if you have the time.
