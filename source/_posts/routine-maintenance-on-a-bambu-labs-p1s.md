I was getting a bunch of layer lines or Vertical Fine Artifacts (VFAs) on my printer and figured it was time for some routine maintenance. Follow along with me as I clean up the rods and re-tension the belts to get the printer back to performing at 100%

### Supplies Needed

1. Bottle of Isopropyl Alcohol

2. Rag

3. Rod Sloth Print

4. Bambu Labs or Slick Oleum Grease

Overall this is an easy fix to get your printer performing at 100%.
