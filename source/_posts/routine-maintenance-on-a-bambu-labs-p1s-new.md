I was getting a bunch of layer lines or Vertical Fine Artifacts (VFAs) on my printer and figured it was time for some routine maintenance. Follow along with me as I clean up the rods and re-tension the belts to get the printer back to performing at 100%

### Supplies Needed

1. Bottle of Isopropyl Alcohol
2. Rag
3. [Rod Sloth Print](https://makerworld.com/en/models/120092#profileId-129262)
4. Bambu Labs or Slick Oleum Grease

Overall this is an easy fix to get your printer performing at 100%.
