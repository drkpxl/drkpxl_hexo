I’ve tried a few different AliExpress ADXL’s for tuning my printers over the years. Each one had me solder (which I am not great at), find and read poorly translated how-tos, or deal with making an umbilical. So, after the ADXL on my Voron 0.2 stopped being reliable, I went on a hunt and came across the **MellowFly**. For $15 USD delivered, I felt it was worth the cost.

## A Few Reasons I Like It:

- **Has the Pi 2040 chip**, which is easy to flash and well documented.
- **Has a USB-C port**. Everything in my life is moving to USB-C; it’s easy to find a cable and use it.
- **The setup documentation** is well written and easy to follow.

If you want to buy it, this is where I got it from:

[Mellow Fly ADXL345 Accelerometer USB Board](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004570565456.html) – AliExpress

I also have an STL for how I mount it to my Voron Zero’s Mini Stealthburner. It’s just press fit, so **super easy to install and remove** whenever you need to run Input Shaping. Cop that STL here:
