I had some trouble finding filament profiles online as it seems most people are a bit leery to share theirs. Similar to my Ender 3 S1 3D Printer Profiles I want to start sharing my profiles for my Bambu Labs P1S Printers. These profiles should work equally as well for a P1P, X1C, etc.. If Bambu's default profiles aren't working well for you try this out.

Caveat all these assume you are using Orca Slicer, and if you are not you really should be ;)

## Filament

### PETG

This profile has been testing using Bambu's Basic PETG, Overture PETG and Inland PETG and provides much better results than the default PETG profile. The big changes are adding some additional minimum layer time and upping the fan a bit. Try it out and let me know how it works for you!

### Bambu PETG

The default Bambu profile for their PETG filament is not so great, I tuned it up and got it working alot better for me. Your milage may vary but I think it's worth trying out.
